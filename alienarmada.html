            <p style="font-size: 34px;font-weight: bold;">Alien Invasion Imminent: Extraterrestrial Armada Spotted Lurking Beyond Pluto</p>
            <img src="Images/Aliens.jpg" style="width: 400px;height: 300px;float: right">
            <p style="margin-right: 500px;margin-left: 10px;font-size: 24px;">    In a development that has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, astronomers claim to have detected a massive fleet of alien spacecraft lurking just beyond the edge of our solar system. According to their observations, the armada consists of thousands of unidentified flying objects, each larger than the moon and equipped with advanced weaponry.

                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the mainstream media has largely ignored the reports, conspiracy theorists and UFO enthusiasts have been quick to sound the alarm. They believe that the aliens are preparing to launch a full-scale invasion of Earth, intent on enslaving humanity and plundering our planet's resources.
                
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments around the world have remained tight-lipped about the alleged threat, leading to speculation that they are hiding information from the public. Some even accuse world leaders of colluding with the extraterrestrial invaders in exchange for promises of power and wealth.
                
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As tensions escalate and rumors swirl, ordinary citizens are left to wonder: are we truly alone in the universe, or is our world on the brink of an intergalactic war? Only time will tell, but one thing is for certain: the truth is out there, somewhere beyond the stars.</p>
